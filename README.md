# Honeypot-Soc-Lab
I built a Windows honeypot in Microsoft Azure and exposed it to the internet to capture real attack activity. Logs were sent to Microsoft Sentinel, analyzed with KQL, enriched with GeoIP data, and visualized on an attack map to practice real SOC analyst workflows.




My project consisted of deploying a Windows virtual machine in Microsoft Azure and configuring it as a honeypot by allowing open inbound traffic and disabling the firewall. I generated failed login attempts and captured real-world brute-force activity from the internet. I set up a Log Analytics Workspace and connected Microsoft Sentinel as a SIEM to centralize and monitor security logs. Using the Azure Monitor Agent and Data Collection Rules, I forwarded Windows Security Events (such as Event ID 4625). I then used Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze attack data, enriched logs with geographic IP information using a Sentinel watchlist, and created an interactive attack map to visualize where login attempts were coming from globally
